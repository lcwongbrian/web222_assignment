        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Lap Chi Wong, Brian. I am a graduate of a Physics degree. My hobby is to create
          things that are both visually appealing and hi-tech, combining technology and art. I keep
          focusing on STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics) topics. My
          curiosity drives me to jump from science to programming. In the future I would love to
          explore more in 3D graphics and see what magic it can work out with web, industry 4.0, art
          and more.

        <h2>Why do I choose Texas Hold'em?</h2>
        <p>
          My major game to play in my childhood are poker based games. In the fellow poker games,
          Texas Hold'em requires both probability calculation strategy and psychological skills.
          Although it appears to be gambling, the part involving money can be eliminated for
          leisure.
