              While the exact origins of Texas Hold'em are not well-documented, the game is believed
              to have evolved from earlier poker variations played in the United States during the
              19th and early 20th centuries. It likely originated in Texas, which is how it got the
              name "Texas Hold'em."
            </p>
            <p>
              Robstown, Texas, is often credited as the birthplace of Texas Hold'em. The game is
              said to have been played there in the early 1900s. In the beginning, it was a game
              primarily played among friends and in small gatherings.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 1960s, Texas Hold'em gained popularity in Las Vegas casinos. The game was
              introduced by a group of Texan poker players, including Doyle Brunson and Amarillo
              Slim. They brought the game to the Golden Nugget Casino, where it quickly became a
              hit.
            </p>
            <p>
              The WSOP, established in 1970, further contributed to the rise of Texas Hold'em. The
              introduction of the $10,000 No-Limit Texas Hold'em Main Event as the premier
              tournament attracted attention from poker players worldwide. The tournament's
              popularity soared, leading to increased media coverage and the growth of professional
              poker players.

            <p>
              Starting with the player to the left of the big blind, each player has the option to
              call (match the big blind), raise (increase the bet), or fold (discard their hand and

            <p>
              If there are two or more players remaining after the final betting round, a showdown
              occurs. Players reveal their hole cards, and the best five-card hand is determined
              using the player's hole cards and the five community cards. The player with the
              highest-ranking hand wins the pot.
            </p>
            <h4>Pot Distribution</h4>
            <p>
              The player with the best hand wins the pot. In the event of a tie, the pot is split
              equally among the tied players. After the pot is awarded, the dealer button moves to
              the next player, and a new hand begins.

              Although there are tons of media and books can teach us how to calculate probability
              of the hole cards and the community cards, the rules of thumb is to keep calm.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mental stability is of the utmost importance facing the unknown coming cards and the
              opponents. The moment of posting the pots can reflect ones' confidence on their hole
              cards on hand and this can be the clues for the opponents to judge if they should be
              aggressive. A good player can pretend to be holding the winning hole cards and end up
              winning with hopeless combination.
